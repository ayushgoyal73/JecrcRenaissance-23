       <b>Failure to do so will result in disqualification. </b> <br>
       5. Use of damaged, non-leak proof batteries may lead to
       disqualification. <br>
       6. Change of battery will not be allowed during the match. <br>
       7. It is suggested to have extra batteries ready and charged up during
       competition so that on advancing to next level, you don't have to wait
       or suffer due to uncharged battery. If teams don't show up on allotted
       slot, they will be disqualified. <br>
       <h4>Mobility:</h4>
       1. All robots must have clearly visible and controlled mobility
mechanism in order to compete. <br>
2. Methods of mobility may include: <br>
a. Rolling (wheels, tracks or the whole robot). <br>
b. Walking (linear actuated legs with no rolling or cam operated
motion). <br>
c. Shuffling (rotational cam operated legs). <br>
3. Jumping and hopping is not allowed. <br>
4. Flying (using aero foil, helium balloons, ornithopters, etc.) is not
allowed. <br>
Any other method of mobility which leads the robot to lose contact
with the ground is not allowed. <br>
<h4>Robot Control Requirements:</h4>
1. Both wired and wireless remote controls are allowed in the event. <br>
2. All wires coming out of the robot should be bundled as a single
unit. <br>
3. The wires should be properly protected and insulated. <br>
4. The wire should be sufficiently long so as to remain slack at all
time during the competition. <br>
5. In case of wireless remote controls, the remote should have at least
two frequency operations to prevent interference with other team. <br>
6. Teams are recommended to attach a pipe to bot in vertical direction
through which wires come out. The length of pipe will not be
considered in bot dimension. <br>
<h4>Pneumatics and Hydraulics</h4>
1. The robot must use non-inflammable and non-corrosive fluids to
power pneumatic and hydraulic devices. <br>
2. Maximum pressure in the tank containing pneumatic fluid should
not exceed the limit of 10 bars and there should be a provision to
check the pressure in the tank. <br>
3. All hydraulic liquids are required to be non-corrosive and your
device should be leak proof. The maximum pressure in cylinder
should not exceed the rated pressure at any point of time. <br>
4. Participants must be able to indicate the used pressure with
integrated or temporarily fitted pressure gauge. <br>
5. You must have a safe way of refilling the system. <br>
6. All pneumatic components on board a robot must be securely
mounted. Care must be taken while mounting the pressure vessel and
armour, to ensure that if ruptured it will not escape the robot. <br>
<h4>Safety Rules:</h4>
Compliance with all event rules is mandatory. It is expected that
competitors stay within the rules and procedures of their own accord
and do not require constant policing. <br>
1. Special care should be taken to protect the on-board batteries and
pneumatics, robot without proper protection will not be allowed to
compete. <br>
2. If you have a robot or weapon design that does not fit within the
categories set forth in these rules or is in some way ambiguous or
borderline, please contact the event organizers. Safe innovation is
always encouraged, but surprising the organizers with your brilliant
exploitation of a loophole may cause your robot to be disqualified
before it even competes. <br>
3. Each event has safety inspections. It is at their sole discretion that
your robot is allowed to compete. As a builder you are obligated to disclose all operating principles and potential dangers to the
inspection staff. <br>
4. Proper activation and deactivation of robots is critical. Robots must
only be activated in the arena, testing areas, or with expressed consent
of the event coordinators. <br>
5. All weapons must have a safety cover on any sharp edges. <br>
6. All participants build and operate robots at their own risk. Combat
robotics is inherently dangerous. There is no amount of regulation that
can encompass all the dangers involved. Please take care to not hurt
yourself or others when building, testing and competing. Any
kind of activity (repairing, battery handling, pneumatics systems etc.)
which may cause damage to the surroundings during the stay of the
teams in the competition area should not be carried out without the
consent of organizers. Not following this rule may result in
disqualification. <br>
7. All the resources provided at the time of competition from the
organizers should be strictly used only after the consent of the
organizers. <br>
8. Once the robots should enter into the arena, no team member can
enter into the arena at any point of time. In case if a fight has to be
halted in between and some changes have to be done in the arena or
condition on the robot(s), it will be done by organizers only. <br>
<h4>Note:</h4>
<p>Qualification of a robot to next level be subjective and totally on the
  decision of the judges. A robot winning in a round against its
  opponent doesn't guarantee its entrance into the next round. If the
  judges found the winner. Robot incompetent to enter into the next
round, it may get disqualified. Judges can disqualify both the robots
of a match from advancing to the next round.
